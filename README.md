# COMP2003-2023 : Cotton Leaf Disease Detection App

## Overview
We are tasked with developing an Android application for our client, focusing on distinguishing between healthy and diseased cotton leaves, specifically targeting leaf curl disease. The primary objective is to create a user-centric mobile app featuring an intuitive interface.
Our client has provided us with the model code to classify healthy/diseased cotton leaves. Our task is to integrate this into a functioning app and edit the inputted data so that the code can identify the leaf correctly.

## Usage
-To use the application the user should create an account or login to their previously created account
-The user can then scan a leaf from whatever page they'd like by using the camera button on the navigation bar
-The user can change their language preferences and location via the settings page
-Alongside this they can also view how many leaves they have detected aswell as viewing necessary information on the leaf curl disease
-The user can logout whenever they feel via the Profile page whilst also being able to change any personal information
